Not found yet)) <br />
Works pretty stable in latest Dartium\Chrome\Opera, Firefox and IE11. <br />
Running in Firefox the WebStorm raises a warning: <br />
` WARNING: dart:mirrors support in dart2js is experimental,
          and not recommended.
          This implementation of mirrors is incomplete,
          and often greatly increases the size of the generated
          JavaScript code.
